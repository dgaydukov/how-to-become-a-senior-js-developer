### Intro

Here is my list of certification every java architect should have. There are a lot of arguments over the internet about utility of such certification. 
I think certification is very useful, but in a bit different way, than most people think. Unfortunately there is a confusion in the market, that once you got certification it will dramatically help your career.
Although it may help in your career, the main goal of certification is to enlarge you knowledge in some subject. When you study to certification you will learn a lot of new stuff, that always was there, you just didn't use it.
So to sum up, it may help directly (like some company will hire you or promote you because you have some certificates), but it also will help indirectly, cause during certification you will learn a lot of new stuff, and this will enhance your knowledge.
