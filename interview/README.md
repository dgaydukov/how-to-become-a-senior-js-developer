# Interesting Interview


### Description

Finally i decided to move interview questions outside algorithm folder. The reason for this, is because usually on interview you are asked all kind of questions
not necessarily related to algorithms. So interview question doesn't relate algorithm folder. But they also doesn't relate to any other folder here. So that's why
I decided to move them out into kind of a different project.

Why I put them there ont the first place. Well it's a good question. Probably because when i first started this repo, all interview questions I have remembered
where related to some algorithmic tasks, that's why initially I put it there. But as the repo grows, and I attend more interview, I decided to move it out.
