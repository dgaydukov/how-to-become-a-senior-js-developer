## React steps
 * ESLint (Standard Style) to use one style system
 * move all logic to redux-thunk, in order to keep clean reducers
 * use PureComponent instead of Component
 * add PostCSS, and use plugins for optimization (autoprefixer)
 * move to ES6/ES7 (spread instead of Object.assign(), async/await instead of callback)
