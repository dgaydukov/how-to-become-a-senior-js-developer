### Description
Here i will share interesting algorithmic tasks that i met in my school informatics subject & career as programmer.

### Why to learn

Algorithms is very important in developer life. If you want to be a good dev you should know at least some basics.
[Here](https://github.com/dgaydukov/how-to-become-a-senior-js-developer/blob/master/algorithm/why-to-learn.md) are my detailed overview why you should learn them.
