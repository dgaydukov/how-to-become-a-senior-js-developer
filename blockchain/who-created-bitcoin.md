### Description
Well, we all know that bitcoin was created by a guy named [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto).
Unfortunately nobody knows him, so we can't say for sure is it a real person or a group.
My acquaintance with bitcoin took place in the mid of 2015. Since that i'm constantly go deeper into it's concept.
The more i went deeper the more it come to me that bitcoin is not a new digital currency. Bitcoin is a new world. It's a set of more
than 10 different (old & new) technologies that combine together and form bitcoin.
Here is a short list of them.
