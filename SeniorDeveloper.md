# Senior Dev

## Who is SeniorDev

Well, before we dive into a path on becomming senior developer in js, we should stop and answer, who is this mysterious SeniorDev.
As I can judge, SeniorDev is the guy who can solve things. No matter what, any task that was set up for him, he can find a solution.

## Tasks
The tasks are pretty broad. You can't just say "I can solve this, this and this, so I'm SeniorDev".

## Examples

### Git
* move on 3 commits ago


### React steps
 * ESLint (Standard Style) to use one style system
 * move all logic to redux-thunk, in order to keep clean reducers
 * use PureComponent instead of Component
 * add PostCSS, and use plugins for optimization (autoprefixer)
 * move to ES6/ES7 (spread instead of Object.assign(), async/await instead of callback)
